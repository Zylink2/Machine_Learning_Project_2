- Please visit our analysis by going to: Analysis > analysis3_final.ipynb 
- We performed EDA by utilising Pandas, Numpy for data manipulation and analysis
- We also employed Seaborn, Matplotlib for effective visualisation of data characteristics
- Lastly, we researched on migration and aging society in thailand, and found interesting and concerning points which can be summarised as below.

Summary: From various graphs and analyses, including identified problems and causes, it can be concluded that the significant impact of population relocation on aging society is the increased likelihood of elderly individuals being left alone. Reasons for relocation include job seeking, education, or simply pursuing a more comfortable lifestyle elsewhere. Whether individuals relocate officially or not, another major cause leading to elderly isolation is the declining birth rate, attributed to increased living costs, a preference for flexible lifestyles among many, and overall economic conditions. In response to these factors, suitable strategies must be implemented to address the challenges arising in an aging society.
